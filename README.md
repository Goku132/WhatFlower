# WhatFlower
A app that take a photo of a flower and using coreML and oxford102.caffe model.
Can identify the flower from the photo taken by your iPhone camera. 
We added a function that returned the wikipedia info as well as the pic.

The Flour classification ML model was too big for github if you wish to create it using the coreML python tools and the oxford caffe model.
